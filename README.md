# scratch-2-py

## What is this?
Scratch-2-py: The python implementation of PullJosh's Leopard. Inspired by PullJosh's [Leopard](https://github.com/PullJosh/leopard), and his [sb-edit](https://github.com/PullJosh/sb-edit), this implementation tries to convert scratch JSON into tokens, turn them into scratchblocks, then, using those scratchblocks, make a pygame game.

The parsing of JSON could be a sepreate repo.... 

## WARNING
THIS IS STILL HIGHLY IN-DEV. THIS IS STILL IN IT'S EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. The formatting guidelines are still WIP, too.
