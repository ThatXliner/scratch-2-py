# scratch-2-py

NOTE: README still under construction. And I'm also not done

## What is this?

**Scratch-2-py: The python implementation of PullJosh's Leopard.**

_TL;DR_: This turns scratch projects into python.

Inspired by PullJosh's [Leopard](https://github.com/PullJosh/leopard), and his [sb-edit](https://github.com/PullJosh/sb-edit), this implementation tries to convert the crazy ugly scratch JSON (which we call sb-JSON) into a cleaner, more generic, JSON (instead of JavaScript objects). Then, parsing the JSON, this program will make a [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) game.

**NOTE: I personally don't know pygame that much so any experts should contribute**

The parsing of JSON into much more easily readable (and usable) could be a separate repo.... :thinking:

You can use the JSON to a cleaner, more generic, JSON python script in

<u>
  <code>sbJSON2clean/GOOD_JSON.json</code>
</u>

or the scratchblocks representation in

<u>
  <code>sbJSON2clean/scratchblock_repr.txt</code>
</u>.

## Features

This project features the following:

- A decent sbJson to JSON converter (which may become it's separate Github repo in the future)
- A python API (since it's written in python)
- A decent README (WIP)
- And more!

---

## Future Features

In the future, we plan to add the following features:

[ ] A command line interface
[ ] A decent API
[ ] A better README
[ ] Documentation
[ ] Leopard integration

But for now, our highest priority is:

`Finishing this project`

# Code style

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Black is pretty strict, and you can't configure it. Well, all we care about is the code, not the style.

# A little warning

:warning: THIS IS STILL HIGHLY IN-DEV. **THIS IS STILL IN IT'S _very_ EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT**.
