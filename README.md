NOTE: README still under construction.

## What is this?

**Scratch-2-py: The python implementation of PullJosh's Leopard.**

_TL;DR_: This turns scratch projects into python.

Inspired by PullJosh's [Leopard](https://github.com/PullJosh/leopard), and his [sb-edit](https://github.com/PullJosh/sb-edit), this implementation tries to convert the crazy ugly scratch JSON (which we call sb-JSON) into a cleaner, more generic, JSON and turn them into much more readable [scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks). Then, parsing those scratchblocks, this program will make a [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) game.

The parsing of JSON into much more easily readable (and usable) could be a separate repo.... :thinking:

You can use the JSON to a cleaner, more generic, JSON python script in

<u>
  <code>sbJSON2clean/GOOD_JSON.json</code>
</u>

or the scratchblocks representation in

<u>
  <code>sbJSON2clean/scratchblock_repr.txt</code>
</u>

.

:warning: THIS IS STILL HIGHLY IN-DEV. **THIS IS STILL IN IT'S _very_ EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT**.

The formatting guidelines are still WIP, too.
